The `Netflow V5 <http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/solutions_docs/netflow/nfwhite.html>`_ processor is the Logisland entry point to  process Netflow (V5) events. NetFlow is a feature introduced on Cisco routers that provides the ability to collect IP network traffic.We can distinguish 2 components:

	- Flow exporter: aggregates packets into flows and exports flow records (binary format) towards one or more flow collectors

	- Flow collector: responsible for reception, storage and pre-processing of flow data received from a flow exporter

The collected data are then available for analysis purpose (intrusion detection, traffic analysis...)
Netflow are sent to kafka in order to be processed by logisland.
In the tutorial we will simulate Netflow traffic using `nfgen <https://github.com/pazdera/NetFlow-Exporter-Simulator>`_. this traffic will be sent to port 2055. The we rely on nifi to listen of that port for   incoming netflow (V5) traffic and send them to a kafka topic. The Netflow processor could thus treat these events and generate corresponding logisland records. The following processors in the stream can then process the Netflow records generated by this processor.
