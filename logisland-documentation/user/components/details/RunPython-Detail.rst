 !!!! WARNING !!!!

The RunPython processor is currently an experimental feature : it is delivered as is, with the current set of features and is subject to modifications in API or anything else in further logisland releases without warnings. There is no tutorial yet. If you want to play with this processor, use the python-processing.yml example and send the apache logs of the index apache logs tutorial. The debug stream processor at the end of the stream should output events in stderr file of the executors from the spark console.

This processor allows to implement and run a processor written in python. This can be done in 2 ways. Either directly defining the process method code in the **script.code.process** configuration property or poiting to an external python module script file in the **script.path** configuration property. Directly defining methods is called the inline mode whereas using a script file is called the file mode. Both ways are mutually exclusive. Whether using the inline of file mode, your python code may depend on some python dependencies. If the set of python dependencies already delivered with the Logisland framework is not sufficient, you can use the **dependencies.path** configuration property to give their location. Currently only the nltk python library is delivered with Logisland.
