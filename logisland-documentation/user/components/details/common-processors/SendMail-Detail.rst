The SendMail processor is aimed at sending an email (like for instance an alert email) from an incoming record. There are three ways an incoming record can generate an email according to the special fields it must embed. Here is a list of the record fields that generate a mail and how they work:

- **mail_text**: this is the simplest way for generating a mail. If present, this field means to use its content (value) as the payload of the mail to send. The mail is sent in text format if there is only this special field in the record. Otherwise, used with either mail_html or mail_use_template, the content of mail_text is the aletrnative text to the HTML mail that is generated.

- **mail_html**: this field specifies that the mail should be sent as HTML and the value of the field is mail payload. If mail_text is also present, its value is used as the alternative text for the mail. mail_html cannot be used with mail_use_template: only one of those two fields should be present in the record.

- **mail_use_template**: If present, this field specifies that the mail should be sent as HTML and the HTML content is to be generated from the template in the processor configuration key **html.template**. The template can contain parameters which must also be present in the record as fields. See documentation of html.template for further explanations. mail_use_template cannot be used with mail_html: only one of those two fields should be present in the record.

 If **allow_overwrite** configuration key is true, any mail.* (dot format) configuration key may be overwritten with a matching field in the record of the form mail_* (underscore format). For instance if allow_overwrite is true and mail.to is set to config_address@domain.com, a record generating a mail with a mail_to field set to record_address@domain.com will send a mail to record_address@domain.com.

 Apart from error records (when he is unable to process the incoming record or to send the mail), this processor is not expected to produce any output records.
