/**
 * In information theory and computer science, the Levenshtein distance is a
 * string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences.
 *
 * Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number
 * of single-character edits (insertion, deletion, substitution) required to
 * change one word into the other. The phrase edit distance is often used to
 * refer specifically to Levenshtein distance.
 *
 * It is named after Vladimir Levenshtein, who considered this distance in 1965.
 * [1] It is closely related to pairwise string alignments.
